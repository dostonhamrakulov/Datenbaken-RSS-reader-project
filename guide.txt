Task Description:
1. Backend:
	- Database consistency - https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27386/consistency-databases



1. I have updated DB
	- making a link (web_feed_provider) not unique
	- rename ids (feed_id -> id, provider_id -> id)

2. Response with json result set or Not Found status
	- get feed by ID then if not exists, returns not found


Questions:
	- Can a user delete individual web_feed?
	- Can a user update web_feed_provider?

	- adding web_feed_provider:
Frontend send a request with link, and should there be user_id?


	- changed Users tabel --> User table with user_id --> id




3. Let's not push some file like .class or .project, or .iml
