Task Description:
1. Backend:
	- Database consistency - https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27386/consistency-databases



1. I have updated DB
	- making a link (web_feed_provider) not unique
	- rename ids (feed_id -> id, provider_id -> id)

2. Response with json result set or Not Found status
	- get feed by ID then if not exists, returns not found


Questions:
	- Can a user delete individual web_feed?
	- Can a user update web_feed_provider?

	- adding web_feed_provider:
Frontend send a request with link, and should there be user_id?


	- changed Users tabel --> User table with user_id --> id




3. Let's not push some file like .class or .project, or .iml

1. Frontend should have "update" button and 
	- Backend prevents the updating of web feeds in a too small time interval, so that it waits at least 10 minutes between two requests for a web feed (and blocks other requests to do so).


2. Existing records can also be updated, but no duplicates are created.

3. When provider is deleted by user then we should delete all of its feeds but:
	- when we add new provider_1 for user_1 then all feeds from provider_1 will be stored in web feeds with providerid=provider_1.id then
	- user_2 wants to add the same provider_1 and we can add it with different id BUT
	- once we delete provider_1 for user_1 then we will delete of feeds of provider_1 with providerid and user_2 will not see the feed from the same provider_1 until next time interval
